# Vercel Doorman WWW

This is the website for the Vercel Doorman project. It is a static site built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Prebuild Script

The `prebuild.mjs` script is used to fetch the JSON Schema from the main `vercel-doorman` github repository and save it to the `public` directory. This is done so that the schema is available on a public URL and can be used in within other projects.
